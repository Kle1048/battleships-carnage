This commit adds more realistic ship controls to the game:

- Added discrete throttle settings: Flank, Half, Slow, Stop, Reverse Half, Reverse Full
- Added discrete rudder settings: Full Left, Half Left, Ahead, Half Right, Full Right
- Implemented more realistic ship physics:
  - Gradual acceleration and deceleration
  - Turning effectiveness based on speed
  - Reduced turning ability in reverse
  - Slight drift when turning at speed
- Added visual feedback showing current throttle and rudder settings
- Updated input handling to support key press events
- Added multiple control options:
  - W/S: Increase/decrease throttle
  - A/D: Turn rudder left/right
  - 1-6: Direct throttle settings
  - Q/E/R: Direct rudder settings
  - Space: Center rudder
