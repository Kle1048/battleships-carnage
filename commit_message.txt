[Cursor] Improve ship controls display and fix TypeScript error

This commit makes the following improvements:

1. Fixed TypeScript error:
   - Added type assertion to the addChild method call in the Ship class
   - Resolves the error: "Argument of type 'Text' is not assignable to parameter of type 'DisplayObject'"

2. Improved UI for ship controls:
   - Moved ship controls display from individual ships to the top of the screen
   - Created a dedicated UI container that stays fixed on screen
   - Added separate text elements for:
     - Connection status (left side)
     - Ship controls reference (right side)
     - Current throttle and rudder settings (center)
   - Improved text styling with drop shadows and better contrast
   - Used nautical terminology for throttle and rudder settings

3. Removed redundant status text from ships
   - Simplified ship rendering
   - Improved performance by reducing text objects

These changes make the game more user-friendly and provide clearer feedback about the current ship controls.
