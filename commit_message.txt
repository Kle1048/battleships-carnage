[Cursor] Improve ship controls display and fix TypeScript error

This commit makes the following improvements:

1. Fixed TypeScript error:
   - Added type assertion to the addChild method call in the Ship class
   - Resolves the error: "Argument of type 'Text' is not assignable to parameter of type 'DisplayObject'"

2. Improved UI for ship controls:
   - Moved ship controls display from individual ships to the top of the screen
   - Created a dedicated UI container that stays fixed on screen
   - Added separate text elements for:
     - Connection status (left side)
     - Ship controls reference (right side)
     - Current throttle and rudder settings (center)
   - Improved text styling with drop shadows and better contrast
   - Used nautical terminology for throttle and rudder settings

3. Removed redundant status text from ships
   - Simplified ship rendering
   - Improved performance by reducing text objects

These changes make the game more user-friendly and provide clearer feedback about the current ship controls.

[Cursor] Implement realistic ship controls with discrete throttle and rudder settings

This commit adds more realistic ship controls to the game:

- Added discrete throttle settings: Flank, Half, Slow, Stop, Reverse Half, Reverse Full
- Added discrete rudder settings: Full Left, Half Left, Ahead, Half Right, Full Right
- Implemented more realistic ship physics:
  - Gradual acceleration and deceleration
  - Turning effectiveness based on speed
  - Reduced turning ability in reverse
  - Slight drift when turning at speed
- Added visual feedback showing current throttle and rudder settings
- Updated input handling to support key press events
- Added multiple control options:
  - W/S: Increase/decrease throttle
  - A/D: Turn rudder left/right
  - 1-6: Direct throttle settings
  - Q/E/R: Direct rudder settings
  - Space: Center rudder
- Updated documentation in README.md 

[Cursor] Fix TypeScript error in Ship class

This commit fixes a TypeScript error related to PixiJS v7 type compatibility:

- Added type assertion to the addChild method call in the Ship class
- Resolves the error: "Argument of type 'Text' is not assignable to parameter of type 'DisplayObject'"
- This is a similar issue to the other PixiJS type compatibility errors we fixed earlier 

[Cursor] Fix network connection issues for local multiplayer

This commit addresses several issues related to network connectivity for local multiplayer:

1. Fixed IP address configuration:
   - Updated .env file with the correct local IP address
   - Added proper error handling for connection failures

2. Enhanced server configuration:
   - Updated Content Security Policy to allow connections from local network
   - Configured server to listen on all network interfaces
   - Added better CORS configuration for cross-origin requests

3. Improved client-side error handling:
   - Added detailed error messages for connection issues
   - Implemented better reconnection logic
   - Enhanced status display with more information

4. Added network testing tools:
   - Created a dedicated network test page
   - Added port checking utility
   - Created firewall configuration helper

5. Added firewall configuration:
   - Created batch file to add Windows Firewall rule
   - Documented network setup process

These changes enable playing the game with multiple devices on the local network,
making it possible to test the multiplayer functionality with real players.

[Cursor] Implement collision detection and ship damage system

This commit adds collision detection and a ship damage system to the game:

1. Collision Detection:
   - Added circle-based collision detection between ships
   - Implemented collision response with ships pushing each other away
   - Added visual feedback for collisions (ship flashing)
   - Collision damage based on relative speed and ship type

2. Ship Damage System:
   - Added health tracking for ships
   - Implemented damage application with visual feedback
   - Ships change appearance based on damage level (color tinting)
   - Added ship destruction when health reaches zero
   - Implemented ship respawning after destruction

3. UI Improvements:
   - Added health bar to show player ship's current health
   - Added damage indicator when player takes damage
   - Ships change color based on damage level (more red as damage increases)

4. Multiplayer Synchronization:
   - Added damage reporting to the server
   - Synchronized ship damage across all clients
   - Implemented ship destruction and respawning events
   - Server validates and broadcasts damage events

These changes make the game more interactive and add consequences to ship collisions, bringing the gameplay closer to the requirements in the specification document.

[Cursor] Fix collision detection and health bar positioning

This commit addresses two issues with the collision detection and UI:

1. Fixed Health Bar Positioning:
   - Moved the health bar to the center of the screen
   - Positioned it above the ship controls status
   - Added automatic repositioning when window is resized

2. Improved Collision Detection:
   - Fixed issue where collisions weren't being detected between ships
   - Increased collision radius for all ship types for better gameplay
   - Added visual indicator of collision radius (red circle) for debugging
   - Improved collision response with stronger push force
   - Added minimum damage on collision to ensure feedback
   - Added detailed debug logging for collision detection

3. Enhanced Ship Visuals:
   - Redesigned ship sprites using PIXI.Graphics for better performance
   - Simplified ship shapes for clearer visual identification
   - Added proper anchoring and positioning

These changes make the game more playable by ensuring collisions work properly
and improving the UI layout for better visibility of important game information.
