1. Collision Detection:
   - Added circle-based collision detection between ships
   - Implemented collision response with ships pushing each other away
   - Added visual feedback for collisions (ship flashing)

   - Synchronized ship damage across all clients
   - Implemented ship destruction and respawning events
   - Server validates and broadcasts damage events

These changes make the game more interactive and add consequences to ship collisions, bringing the gameplay closer to the requirements in the specification document.

[Cursor] Fix collision detection and health bar positioning

This commit addresses two issues with the collision detection and UI:

1. Fixed Health Bar Positioning:
   - Moved the health bar to the center of the screen
   - Positioned it above the ship controls status
   - Added automatic repositioning when window is resized

2. Improved Collision Detection:
   - Fixed issue where collisions weren't being detected between ships
   - Increased collision radius for all ship types for better gameplay
   - Added visual indicator of collision radius (red circle) for debugging
   - Improved collision response with stronger push force
   - Added minimum damage on collision to ensure feedback
   - Added detailed debug logging for collision detection

3. Enhanced Ship Visuals:
   - Redesigned ship sprites using PIXI.Graphics for better performance
   - Simplified ship shapes for clearer visual identification
   - Added proper anchoring and positioning

These changes make the game more playable by ensuring collisions work properly
and improving the UI layout for better visibility of important game information.

[Cursor] Fix gameplay and UI issues

This commit addresses several gameplay and UI issues:

1. Improved Spawn Positions:
   - Increased the range of random spawn points across the entire map (0-2500 range)
   - Added random initial rotation for ships
   - Prevents immediate collisions at game start
   - Applied same improvements to ship respawning

2. Fixed Ship Orientation:
   - Redesigned ship sprites to point in the direction of movement
   - Improved ship shape with more detailed polygon design
   - Added clear front/back distinction for better visual feedback

3. Adjusted Collision Detection:
   - Reduced collision circle size to better match the ship sprite
   - Destroyer: 20px radius (was 40px)
   - Cruiser: 30px radius (was 50px)
   - Battleship: 40px radius (was 60px)

4. Fixed UI Layout:
   - Moved ship controls text down to 80px from top (was 20px)
   - Eliminated overlap between health bar and controls
   - Maintained centered alignment for better readability

These changes improve the gameplay experience by providing better initial
positioning, clearer visual feedback, and a more intuitive UI layout.

[Cursor] Fix ship orientation and movement direction

This commit fixes the ship orientation issue where ships weren't pointing in their movement direction:

1. Fixed Ship Movement Direction:
   - Updated the movement calculations to match PixiJS coordinate system
   - Changed from using sin/cos to cos/sin for proper directional movement
   - Ships now move in the direction they're pointing

2. Fixed Drift Calculations:
   - Updated drift component calculations to match the new movement system
   - Maintained the same drift behavior but with correct orientation

3. Added Detailed Comments:
   - Clarified the coordinate system and rotation conventions
   - Explained how rotation and movement direction are related

This fix ensures that ships visually point in the direction they're moving,
making the game more intuitive and easier to play.

[Cursor] Improve collision physics with realistic bounce effect

This commit enhances the collision response system with more realistic physics:

1. Improved Collision Prevention:
   - Added overlap detection and resolution to prevent ships from moving into each other
   - Ships now properly separate when they collide
   - Implemented immediate position correction to prevent clipping

2. Added Realistic Bounce Physics:
   - Implemented a light bounce effect based on physics principles
   - Bounce intensity varies based on ship mass (destroyer, cruiser, battleship)
   - Velocity changes are proportional to the collision impact
   - Head-on collisions result in more significant speed reduction

3. Enhanced Collision Response:
   - Ships now slow down after collisions
   - Added directional awareness (ships moving toward each other bounce differently)
   - Bounce effect scales with relative speed and mass
   - Maintained damage system based on collision force

These changes make ship interactions more realistic and satisfying, while
preventing the frustrating experience of ships overlapping or getting stuck
together after collisions.

[Cursor] Hide collision circle for cleaner visuals

This commit makes a simple visual improvement:

1. Hidden Collision Circle:
   - Commented out the code that draws the red collision circle
   - Collision detection still works exactly the same
   - Ships now have a cleaner visual appearance
   - Debugging visualization can be easily re-enabled if needed

This change improves the game's visual presentation while maintaining all the
collision functionality that was previously implemented.

[Cursor] Add game over screen and respawn functionality

This commit adds a game over condition and respawn system:

1. Game Over Screen:
   - Added a semi-transparent overlay when player ship is destroyed
   - Created a "SHIP DESTROYED" message with dramatic styling
   - Added a rejoin button with hover effects
   - Game controls are disabled during game over state

2. Respawn Functionality:
   - Added client-side respawn request system
   - Implemented server-side respawn handling
   - Player gets a new ship with random position and rotation
   - New ship may be a different type (destroyer, cruiser, battleship)
   - Other players are notified when a player respawns

3. Technical Improvements:
   - Added mouse position tracking and hit testing
   - Implemented button interaction with hover effects
   - Added proper cleanup and state reset on respawn
   - Ensured proper synchronization between client and server

This feature completes the ship destruction and respawn cycle, giving players
a clear indication when they've been destroyed and allowing them to rejoin
the battle with a new ship.

[Cursor] Fix TypeScript error in respawn functionality

This commit fixes a TypeScript error in the NetworkManager class:

1. Type Compatibility Issue:
   - Fixed error: "Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'ShipType'"
   - Added proper type definition for ShipType in NetworkManager.ts
   - Updated Player interface to use the ShipType type instead of string
   - Added appropriate type assertion when assigning player.type to ship.type

2. Improved Type Safety:
   - Ensured consistent type usage between Ship and NetworkManager classes
   - Maintained the string literal union type ('destroyer' | 'cruiser' | 'battleship')
   - Prevents potential runtime errors from invalid ship types

This fix ensures type safety when handling ship respawning, particularly when
the server assigns a new ship type to the player during respawn.

[Cursor] Fix TypeScript errors and enhance weapon system

This commit addresses several TypeScript errors and enhances the weapon system:

1. Fixed TypeScript Errors:
   - Updated property names from 'throttleSetting' to 'throttle' in Game.ts
   - Updated property names from 'rudderSetting' to 'rudder' in Game.ts
   - Added type assertion to fix removeChild method in Projectile.ts

2. Enhanced Weapon System:
   - Projectiles now fire toward the mouse pointer direction
   - Added maximum range limit for projectiles (500px for cannons, 700px for torpedoes)
   - Added water splash effect when projectiles expire or reach maximum range
   - Improved projectile spread pattern around the target direction

3. Technical Improvements:
   - Added distance tracking for projectiles
   - Enhanced projectile serialization for network synchronization
   - Improved visual feedback with animated water splash effects
   - Fixed world-to-screen coordinate conversion for mouse targeting

These changes make the combat system more intuitive and visually appealing,
while fixing the TypeScript errors that were preventing compilation.
